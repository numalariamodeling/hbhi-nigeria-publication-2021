        # Probability an individual avoids infectious exposure
        # Explanation of approach: 
        # We need to calculate the probability a given individual avoids infectious exposure in a month using the number of individuals who get new infections 
        #    in that month (num_new) and the population size (pop_size). However, if individuals recover quickly from earlier infections, they could 
        #    be counted as having a new infection multiple times within a month. This double counting is not likely to make much difference to the 
        #    overall probability of infection when the number of new infections is much smaller than the population size, but becomes more and more 
        #    important as the number of new infections approaches (or exceeds) the population size. Ignoring the double counting will lead to 
        #    underestimating the probability an individual gets 0 infections in the month if many people are getting multiple infections. In addition, 
        #    since we are interested in infectious exposure rather than any new infection, the denominator is really the number of people who are not 
        #    currently infected, ignoring this will lead to overestimates of the probability an individual avoids infectious exposure. 
        #      --> est_prob_avoid_infection1a = (1-num_new/pop_size)  # could be negative
        #      --> est_prob_avoid_infection1b = (1-num_new/(pop_size*(1-prev)))  # could be negative
        #      --> est_prob_avoid_infection1b <= true_prob_avoid_infection
        #    Another approach would be to look at the probability an individual avoids infection on every day of the month, by approximating 
        #    the number of new infections on each day as the average daily number within the month. However, this won't give the appropriate value 
        #    either, because it isn't the number of infectious exposures (which would give probability of avoiding infection in the month), it's the 
        #    number of infectious exposures among individuals who aren't currently infected. The denominator of what is being observed is 
        #    actually (1-prev)*pop_size rather than pop_size, so estimates will be too large.
        #      --> est_prob_avoid_infection2a = (1-num_new/30/pop_size)^30
        #      --> est_prob_avoid_infection2a >= true_prob_avoid_infection 
        #    However, since we know the prevalence during that month, we can use that to calculate the true denominator of people who could be 
        #    observed to have a new infection. pop_size_adjusted = pop_size*(1-prev). If prevalence and rate of new infections are relatively 
        #    uniform throughout the month, this should give a reasonable approximation of the probability any given individual avoids getting a 
        #    new infectious exposure during the month. 
        #      --> est_prob_avoid_infection2b = (1-num_new/30/(pop_size*(1-prev)))^30
        #      --> est_prob_avoid_infection2b ~= true_prob_avoid_infection

    # women with malaria in pregnancy are more likely to have severe anemia (a type of severe malaria) than non-pregnant adults.
    # Schantz-Dunn and Nour (2009. 'Malaria and Pregnancy: A Global Health Perspective') suggest that the risk of severe disease is
    #   three times higher during pregnancy. They cite two books I can't access (Infectious Disease in Obstetrics and Gynecology and
    #   WHO, Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria), but I'm not certain where the number is from or whether it is actually very robust.
    #   Actually, a number of groups cite the same number and sources.
    # Another approach is to look at the values reported in Desai et al. They report that 5-10% of pregnant women develop severe anaemia
    #   and around 26% of these instances are attributable to malaria (averaged across all gravidities, though paucigravidae).
    #   They also say that preventing malaria reduces risk of severe maternal anaemia by 38%
    # I think the best source is Guyatt and Snow 2001 (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.102.468&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
    #    Their lit review found that in Banfora, Burkina Faso, the  15.7% of first-time pregnant women with malaria had severe anemia compared to
    #    10.0% without malaria. As a guess from these numbers, we could say that 5.7% of women in their first pregnancy who are infected with
    #    malaria and who would not otherwise have had severe anemia get severe anemia as a result of malaria infection.
    # Because I don't have numbers on second pregnancies or later, I think I'll take a similar approach as for mLBW and assume that the first
    #    and second pregnancies have the same risk and that there is no risk for later pregnancies. This is probably too much risk for the second
    #    pregnancy and too little risk for the later ones, but lacking numbers to guide estimates, hopefully they will balance one another.
    # default value: prob_severe_from_MiP = 0.057 
    # 
    # however, we expect fewer individuals to get severe disease from MiP if they are using IPTps. Shulman et al. 1999 ('Intermittent
    #   sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to prevent severe anaemia secondary to malaria in pregnancy: a randomised placebo-controlled trial')
    #   found a protective efficacy of 39% among women with SP (group included 1, 2, or 3 doses) compared to placebo for severe anaemia.
    #   This is among women with and without malaria, so actual protection would likely be higher among individuals with malaria.
    #    However, the study was done in an area of 74% prevalence and an area of 49% prevalence in 1-9 year old children.
    #   there didn't seem to be a difference depending on number of doses, so perhaps I'll use just two values: one for if IPTp taken
    #   and one for no IPTp.

    # several factors might cause MiP and IPTp to affect the number of clinical cases among pregnant women. First, taking IPTp may prevent 
    #    new malaria cases for the duration of protection (presumably contributing to a decrease in new clinical infections). However, in 
    #    high-transmission settings, most new infections in adults likely do not become clinical. Furthermore, by clearing existing 
    #    infections, there is potential for new infections to be clinical (at least according to how our current model would work if we 
    #    were to model it exlicitly instead of adjusting in post-processing). 
    # Second, given that women with malaria in pregnancy are more likely to have severe malaria, it seems reasonable to imagine that they  
    #    may be more likely to have a clinical case, but I haven't found any numbers on this. In high-transmission regions, many articles 
    #    I read indicated that even pregnant women weren't likely to have malaria symptoms, so for now I'll only count an increase in 
    #    severe disease due to anemia rather than also in clinical cases. In theory, this could lead to a larger number of severe cases
    #    in a month than clinical cases, but given the numbers I think it's unlikely.

    # since I'm modifying severe malaria to account for anemia, I think I'll leave the death rate given severe disease alone. I'll specify the fraction
