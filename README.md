<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

The Nigerian Malaria Elimination Program (NMEP) together with the World Health Organization developed a targeted response to intervention deployment at the local government-level to inform the development of the 2021-2025 National Malaria Strategic Plan, as part of the [High Burden to High Impact response](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-CDS-GMP-2018.25). The [Northwestern University Malaria Modeling Team](https://www.numalariamodeling.org/team.html) were recruited to create a mathematical modeling framework for predicting the impact of four NMEP proposed strategies on malaria morbidity and mortality in each of Nigeria's 774 local government areas (LGA). This repository contains scripts and data for replicating the LGA-level models described in the associated manuscript entitled "Application of mathematical modeling to inform national malaria intervention planning in Nigeria" and the modeling outputs also present in the manuscript and related [R Shiny Application](https://ifeomaozo.shinyapps.io/hbhi-nigeria/). 



## Summary of the Modeling Framework
A three-step process was used to generate LGA-level predictions of potential national strategic plans. At the outset, the goal was to capture the intrinsic potential of each LGA to support malaria transmission in a baseline period before 2010 when most interventions were not scaled up nationwide. Data and geospatial modeled surfaces from 2010 or before were used to group LGAs into epidemiological archetypes. For each archetype, baseline malaria transmission was calibrated to 2010 data. Next, Nigeriaâ€™s intervention history from 2010-20 at the LGA level was imposed on the baseline models to generate 774 LGA-level models up through 2020. Last, various future intervention strategies were applied to the LGA models and intervention impact on prevalence, incidence, and mortality was assessed

### Built With

Models were developed within [EMOD](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-malaria/en/latest/index.html) v2.20, [an agent-based model of *Plasmodium falciparum* Transmission](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-10-303), a coupling of models of temperature-dependent vector lifecycle and vector population dynamics, human disease and immunity, and intervention effects.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started With The Simulation Modeling Framework

### Prerequisites
Install Python 3.6 and dtk-tools following the instructions [here](http://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/dtk-tools/gettingstarted.html). dtk-tools is a set of generic modules created for configuring disease and vector-related simulations, and intervention campaigns in EMOD, and is available upon request from the Institute for Disease Modeling.

The dtk-tools-malaria package is also required as it contains modules specific for modeling malaria. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/aouedraogo/dtk-tools-malaria) and requests for access should also be directed to the Institute for Disease Modeling.



### Seasonality Calibration

Five scripts are provided for replicating archetype-level seasonality calibrations

3. [sweep_seasonal_archetypes.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/hbhi-nigeria-publication-2021/blob/main/simulation/baseline_calibration/sweep_seasonal_archetypes.py): Comprises dtk related configuration builders and scripts for running 50 year burn-ins to establish population immunity (in the absence of ITN use) using larval habitat values, estimated from seasonality calibrations, and in the presence of 2010 archetype-level case management estimates from the Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS).

<!-- POST-PROCESSING-->
## Post-processing 

Adjustment for the impact of IPTp and IPTi on burden projections are done outside the simulation. Adjustment for IPTi occurs before the IPTp adjustment in order to generate relative reduction tables per LGA, which are then used to adjust simulation outputs during the IPTp adjustment.The following scripts are used for post-postprocessing:

### IPTi

1. [master.R](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/hbhi-nigeria-publication-2021/blob/main/IPTi_scaling/master.R): This master script sources and runs associated adjustment scripts for specified scenarios. Included in the scripts are descriptions of assumptions, experiment steps, and prerequisites.   

Since IPTi is only applied in scenario 2, only the case management coverages for scenario 2 is required and it is available [here](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/hbhi-nigeria-publication-2021/blob/main/simulation_inputs/future%20projections/CM/cm_scenario2_increase80_2020_2030.csv). BecauseIPTi has never been historically implemented in Nigeria, Expanded Programme on Immunization coverages for the [first, second and third doses of pentavalent diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/hbhi-nigeria-publication-2021/blob/main/simulation_inputs/future%20projections/IPTi/assumedIPTicov.csv) were extracted from the 2018 DHS and used to substitute for historical coverages as both interventions are expected to be rolled out simultaneously. 


### IPTp 

1. [simAdjustments_mortality_MiP_IPTp_IPTi.R](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/hbhi-nigeria-publication-2021/blob/main/IPTp_mortality_postprocessing/simAdjustments_mortality_MiP_IPTp_IPTi.R): This master script connects to functions and additional scripts for adjusting the simulation output for the impact of IPTp on malaria burden. A description is included on how to use the script as well as prerequisites. 

IPTp scenario coverages is located [here](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/hbhi-nigeria-publication-2021/tree/main/simulation_inputs/future%20projections/IPTp). Scenario adjustment information for IPTp is available [here](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/hbhi-nigeria-publication-2021/blob/main/IPTp_mortality_postprocessing/scenario_adjustment_info.csv).
